# Round 2 Roadmap – CrisisNet

Round 2 focuses on intelligence, real-time coordination, scalability, and completing partial integrations from Round 1. The goal is to evolve CrisisNet from a working prototype into a production-ready, city-scale emergency response system.

---

## 1. AI-Based Crisis Detection & Intelligence (to be added)

- NLP-based analysis of real-time social feeds (Twitter/X, Telegram, SMS)
- Automatic crisis type classification and severity estimation
- Geo-clustering of alerts to detect emerging hotspots

---

## 2. Trust, Credibility & Misinformation Control (to be improved)

- Multi-source alert verification (citizen, authority, social data)
- Dynamic trust and confidence scoring for crises
- Duplicate, fake, and low-credibility alert suppression

---

## 3. Real-Time & Event-Driven System (to be improved)

- WebSockets for live crisis and task updates
- Real-time volunteer and authority dashboard synchronization
- Instant escalation for high-severity events

---

## 4. Citizen Crisis Interface (to be improved)

- Clear crisis type and severity indicators
- Contextual safety instructions and emergency guidance
- Accessibility-focused, calm UI for emergency situations

---

## 5. Advanced Crisis Map & Situation Awareness (to be improved)

- Live crisis heatmaps and affected area visualization
- Shelter, safe-zone, and resource location mapping
- City-level and region-level coordination views

---

## 6. Smart Resource & Volunteer Optimization (to be improved)

- Skill-weighted and distance-aware volunteer matching
- Priority-based resource allocation
- Automatic reassignment on task failure or delay

---

## 7. NGO Coordination & Crisis Acceptance

**Half-implemented in Round 1 → Fully integrated in Round 2**

### Round 1 (Partial):
- NGO APIs and basic crisis acceptance flow
- NGO task views and status endpoints
- Limited integration with crisis lifecycle

### Round 2 (To be completed):

- NGO-to-authority coordination and reporting

---

## 8. Learning & Adaptive Response Agent (to be added)

- Learns from past crisis outcomes and response performance
- Tracks response time and success/failure metrics
- Improves priority scoring and allocation strategies over time

---

## 9. Advanced Routing & Navigation (to be added)

- Safe evacuation route recommendations
- Detection of blocked or high-risk roads
- Dynamic rerouting during ongoing crises

---

## 10. System-Wide Analytics & Dashboards (to be added)

- Crisis trends and response time analytics
- Volunteer and NGO utilization metrics
- Data-driven decision support for authorities

---

## 11. Voice-Based Assistance & Accessibility (to be added)

- Audio-based safety instructions for citizens
- Voice-guided emergency steps
- Support for elderly and visually impaired users

---

## 12. Multi-Crisis Parallel Processing (to be added)

- Parallel handling of multiple crises
- Independent processing pipelines per crisis
- Scalable city, state, and national-level execution
